# Image Crop

This was designed to just be a basic user friendly image cropper and is pretty straight forward as to how it works.  The cropped area is is displayed in a 100x100 canvas below and it has to be scaled to touch at least 2 edges at all times.  When the user pressed the crop button it just displays the area of the cropped area, it does not actually save any cropped image.  It's also intentionally designed so that it does not crop the image under the 2 pixel border.

The actual page is running at the URL below:
