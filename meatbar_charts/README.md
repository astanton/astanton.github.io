# README #

This is a sample that I built which was required to use React, Bootstrap, Google Charts, ES6, and Webpack.  This is the first time I've basically used any of those other than Bootstrap, with very little ES6 and React real world experience.  It is to "simulate" getting data to generate the chart but it is mocked out for demo purposes.  The table shows the users and how many bars they have been to. When you click on a row, it will show you a breakdown of the different bars they went to.  It is all bundled up using webpack.<br/>

You can view a live demo of this here:<br/>
