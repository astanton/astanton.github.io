# Code Samples

Each directory is it's own individual little code sample.  There are separate README files in each of the directories explaining the functionality.

I have more code samples involving more javascript (React.js/ES6/node.js) and mobile (Swift/React Native) technologies that I can provide upon request.

Below are the links to the samples running:
